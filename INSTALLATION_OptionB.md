## Modified Installation Steps for Option B AKA "Pinpoint Eyes"

The default eyes are likely great for most users. However, if you would like to modify the look of your eye to be more like the factory at rest, and produce a small, crisp, pinpoint of light, then you may want to consider Option B.

### Aditional tools neccessary 
 - Two strong gripping tools (pliers, vice, etc.)
 - Eye protection
 - Tweezers
 
## Choosing different eye options 
Speaking franly, I think most people will be very happy with Option A. However, if you want exceptionally crisp eyes, and you don't mind some extra steps, then you may want to consider Option B.

### Option A Overview: Standard Eyes (Simpler, Recommended)
This is the default, easy way to go, and it works great! It was designed to reduce weight, provide a secure method of mounting, and provide more options for creative installations.

This approach has an added benefit of being able to experiment with diffusion inserts which make the eyes look particularly interesting while lit up... but I skipped shipping these on the first round because it is less than ideal. [Beautiful when on, ghostly white eyes when off](media/EyeOptionA_Diffused.JPG). I will publish more info if I can ever find a material that looks good.

This eye style modifies the look of the eye *slightly.* If you are very particular about the look, or you want the smallest visual source of light, you may consider Option B which has tradeoffs that you can explore. For many reasons, including another small bonus coming, Option A is recommended. Unless you are very comfortable with the tradeoffs, I suggest you start here and revisit later if you'd like to change it. The difference at rest very minor. Here is a direct comparison (A on the left, B on the right):

You can also mix and match styles for the eyes, and explore using different diffusion materials. Pro tip: If you are unsure and want to try different eye types before you commit, you can experiment "on the bench" with the robot eyes out of the head. Simply plug the provided USB directly into your computer; all of the related code will work even without Reachy. You can mix and match eye types, or explore other materials.


### Option B Overview: Pinpoint Eyes (Destructive, Advanced, Discouraged)

This is a one directional modification. This option also prevents you from returning your robot to factory eye condition.

**REASONS WHY NOT TO CONSIDER THIS:** There are potential risks to this approach. Pollen or someone in the community may come up with a use for the provided lenses. I've also found that lenses differ between robots. All of my lenses worked, but I'm not sure that they will, so you may go through all of this trouble and this modification does not even work for you. If you are very careful it may be possible to re-use the lenses. If you aren't careful, these seem relatively common so it may also be possible to replace the lenses... but always a lot easier to avoid any potential problems and just go with Option A instead. I will also be releasing a future update that allows you to re-use your existing lenses without any modification. It's not exactly the pinpoint eyes, but may be a good middle ground if you prefer the original look.

Everything said, I would not describe this process as terribly difficult if you want to give it a try. This option is primarily offered to preserve the exact look of the factory robot, or in cases where you specifically want the look of the pinpoint eye. I would not necessarily consider this to be an upgrade, but an alternative. Whether or not it is worth the effort is up to you to decide.  It is also possible to change your mind later.  
 
### Alternative STEP 3 for Pinpoint Eyes 
**Step 3a: Irreversibly Modify Old Lenses**
This step permanently modifies your original lenses. There is no reliable way to restore them afterward. Do not proceed unless you are confident in all of these steps and comfortable with the outcome of everything described here.

WEAR EYE PROTECTION. You are likely to damage your old lenses in this process, and these lenses were never intended for disassembly. I think it is plausible (although unlikely) that you could break glass if not careful. I'm told you can get your eyes replaced if you really needed to, but I'm sure it's expensive and annoying. 

The purpose of this step is to use your pliers to break the glue seal between the lens and the housing. Grip the lens threads with one tool, and the retaining ring with another. Apply steady rotational force in the counterclockwise direction until the seal breaks. You'll see the glue come out of the seal and the parts will turn apart. You will need to grasp tightly enough to keep the housing from spinning but not so tight that you mangle the housing.

Once the seal is broken, the parts can be unscrewed by hand. Some of my lenses did not have the seal at all.

We will be re-using a few of the parts. Yours may be slightly different than the ones I show here but that is OK. Here you can see the parts that you will re-use. They are numbered in the order that they will be installed.

 1) Set the Eye Inserts into the Eye Towers (how they arrived when shipped) 
 2) Place parts labeled 1 and 2 into the center of the Eye Inserts. The first once be installed facing either direction. I slightly prefere the second part to have the flat face outward.
 3) Place part 3 (the large lens) on top of the stack. Note that there is nothing to hold it in place, so you'll need to get the lenses underneath the towers.

I recommend one of the following methods:
 - Gloves method: Handle with clean latex gloves to hold the parts together and flip into place without fingerprints  
 - Lens cloth method: Place cloth over lens, flip tower, gently slide cloth out (added bonus of an extra cleaning swipe when it matters most)  
 
These are the only modifications necessary. Proceed with [Step 4 of the standard installation](INSTALLATION.md#step-4-install-eye-towers).
